# Snake_Game_AI
Used Q Reinforcement Learning method to create an AI that is alright at playing snake. Wasn't able to make it much better than the high score of about 60. Might revisit.

The problem was that the snake wasnt able to see its own body and got often would circle around itself unable to get out without dying. More inputs of the snake body might improve the model
